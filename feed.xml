Documentation for ansible-vault is pretty nice and very helpful, but at some point you will have to think about how to protect your vault password and make it easy to use in your project. Idea in this blog post is to leverage 1password CLI tool to get this password.

One of the solution would be to build a test topology we can access from our CI and use it to run ansible content to validate. Regardless the security aspect of such topology, we thought it is not efficient: if your code is broken, you will eat an ansible error mes... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Build Containerlab topology from AVD</title><link href="https://www.inetsix.net/posts/avd-with-containerlab/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Build Containerlab topology from AVD" /><published>2022-02-04T15:09:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-02-04T17:50:42+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.inetsix.net/posts/avd-with-containerlab/</id> <content src="https://www.inetsix.net/posts/avd-with-containerlab/" /> <author> <name>Thomas Grimonet</name> </author> <category term="Automation" /> <summary> Overview Until recently, if we want to do networking lab, we had option to play with GNS3 or EVE-NG with Virtual Machine for Network OS. But 2021 has seen the rise of Containerlab which gives us ability to play Lab As Code as you can define your own topology in a YAML file. Arista cEOS is natively supported by the tool and gives you opportunity to build lab easily from any type of tool in cha... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Deploy &amp; Configure AWX with Ansible EE</title><link href="https://www.inetsix.net/posts/Ansible-AWX-EE/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Deploy &amp; Configure AWX with Ansible EE" /><published>2022-02-03T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-02-03T13:30:43+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.inetsix.net/posts/Ansible-AWX-EE/</id> <content src="https://www.inetsix.net/posts/Ansible-AWX-EE/" /> <author> <name>Thomas Grimonet</name> </author> <category term="Automation" /> <summary> About This example shows how to deploy basic EVPN/VXLAN Fabric based on Arista Validated Design roles using Ansible Tower/AWX. This repository will be used as project on AWX and we will describe how to configure Tower for the following topics: Create a project Create inventory Install collections Install python requirements Disclaimer This guide was originally published in our Ari... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>eos-download introduction</title><link href="https://www.inetsix.net/posts/eos-download/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="eos-download introduction" /><published>2022-02-01T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-02-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.inetsix.net/posts/eos-download/</id> <content src="https://www.inetsix.net/posts/eos-download/" /> <author> <name>Thomas Grimonet</name> </author> <category term="Arista" /> <summary> In this post, we will see how to use eos-download script to automate your EVE-NG instance with new Arista EOS version for your labs. One of the pain point when you want to test a design is to prepare VMs with correct software version and do the provisioning. So eos-download tries to help provisioning software in EVE-NG to let you start quickly to work on your network things. Install script S... </summary> </entry> </feed>
